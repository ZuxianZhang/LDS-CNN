Here, we propose a general method for predicting small-molecule drug-protein target interactions, LDS-CNN, which extracts features from the network constructed by drug-target interactions and predicts potential drug-target interactions by unifying the encoding of small-molecule drugs and protein targets.
We also provide a protein correspondence interaction file for the external validation set (containing positive and negative samples )
